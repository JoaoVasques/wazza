Wazza
=====================================

<h2>Running instructions</h2>

At the moment, there are two main environments, development and production.

For obvious reasons, we don't use the production environment only development. To run Wazza you must issue the following command
inside the project's directory.

	play -Dconfig.file=conf/dev/application_dev.conf ~run
